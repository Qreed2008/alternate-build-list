<h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Windows 1.04 (English) (pre-1987-04-08)</h1>
<p style="color: #ffffff;">Several places, including BetaWiki, state that 1.04 released on April 8. I, however, cannot find a copy other than the <a href="./1.04 English 1987-04-10">1987-04-10</a> and <a href="./1.04 English 1987-05-11">1987-05-11</a> builds. In addition, several other sites say 1.04 released on 1987-04-10.</p>
