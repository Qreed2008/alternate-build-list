  <h1>Windows 2.0 Beta 1</h1>
  <p>I have this marked as unconfirmed because there <em>could</em> be other Beta 1 builds than the <a href="Beta 1 1987-07-01">1987-07-01</a> build. In fact, "VERSION.H" in the Windows 2.11 OAK contains the following:</p>
  <code>* 1.06b1	19Jun87	Windows 2.0.  1st Beta.</code>
  <p>meaning that there could be Beta 1 builds as early as June 19, 1987.</p>
