  <h1>Windows 2.0 August 1987 build</h1>
  <p>"VERSION.H" in the Windows 2.11 OAK contains the following:</p>
  <code>* 2.00	20Aug87	Windows 2.0 release.</code>
  <p><a href="386 2.01 Compaq OEM">2.01</a> was released in September, and <a href="Post-Beta 2">Post-Beta 2</a> also uses this date, so I'm confused by this.</p>
