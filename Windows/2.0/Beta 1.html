<h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Windows 2.0 Beta 1</h1>
<p style="color: #ffffff;">I have this marked as unconfirmed because there <em>could</em> be other Beta 1 builds than the <a href="./Beta 1 1987-07-01">1987-07-01</a> build. In fact, "VERSION.H" in the <a href="./2.11 OAK">Windows 2.11 OAK</a> contains the following:</p>
<code style="color: #ffffff;">* 1.06b1	19Jun87	Windows 2.0.  1st Beta.</code>
<p style="color: #ffffff;">meaning that there could be Beta 1 builds as early as June 19, 1987.</p>
